# Harrix PyUtilities

All utilities are independent and unrelated to each other.

- [all_files_to_parent_dir](https://github.com/Harrix/harrix-pyutilities/blob/main/src/all_files_to_parent_dir): CLI console script copies files from subdirectories to these folders for each folder in the parent directory.

- [date_from_filename_to_yaml.py](https://github.com/Harrix/harrix-pyutilities/blob/main/src/date_from_filename_to_yaml.py): CLI console script removes the date from the names of folders and markdown (and other) files and transfers (for markdown files) it to YAML. Example: `2022-04-16-test.md` to `test.md`.
